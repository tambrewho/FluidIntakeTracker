  go to FluidTracker in your terminal or CommandPrompt
  type in 'npm start' and click enter

A build should run in your default browser that you can then use to test the project. The first build will be slow because it has to do a bunch of stuff with javascript, but after that, builds should be relatively quick. Once you've finished testing the build, press 'cntrl+c' to end the local server.

We probably should be using this project now just for sake of ease, but it's up to you guys whether or not you want to switch repositories
